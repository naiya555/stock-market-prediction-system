# Indian Stock Market Prediction System

> **Status:** Ongoing Project — Day 3: Market-Data Schema + Source Investigation Complete  
> **Development Philosophy:** `PREDICT → EXPLAIN → VERIFY → EVALUATE → IMPROVE`

## 1. Project Objective

The Indian Stock Market Prediction System is an end-to-end, multi-agent AI and machine-learning platform designed to predict, explain, and evaluate stock movements in the Indian equity markets (NSE/BSE).

The core philosophy of this project is strict integrity and continuous verification:
```
PREDICT ➔ EXPLAIN ➔ VERIFY ➔ EVALUATE ➔ IMPROVE
```
- **Predict:** Generate independent quantitative and contextual predictions.
- **Explain:** Ground predictions with concrete factor attributions and news/event drivers (no unverified post-hoc narratives).
- **Verify:** Record predictions immutably before the market outcome occurs, then capture actual market performance.
- **Evaluate:** Systematically assess directional accuracy, price error (MAE/RMSE), and probability calibration.
- **Improve:** Use verified out-of-sample findings for controlled, versioned model retraining.

## 2. Long-Term Architecture & Workflow

When fully developed, the end-user workflow will operate as follows:

1. **User Interaction:** Select an Indian ticker (e.g., `RELIANCE`, `TCS`, `INFY`) and request a prediction.
2. **Data Orchestration:** Historical OHLCV, technical indicators, current live movement, market breadth, and sector/NIFTY context are retrieved.
3. **Information Pipelines:** Real-time financial news and macroeconomic/regulatory events are collected, deduplicated, and timestamp-indexed.
4. **Independent Model Evaluation:**
   - **Numerical ML:** A gradient-boosted time-series model (e.g., XGBoost / LightGBM) computes expected price movement and directional probability.
   - **Financial NLP:** FinBERT processes extracted financial news to compute structured sentiment features.
   - **Contextual LLM:** An LLM performs structured context analysis and produces an independent prediction with rationale and risk factors.
5. **Ensemble & Synthesis Layer:** Combines numerical ML and LLM predictions transparently, retaining independent scores.
6. **Immutable Output:** Outputs direction (`UP` / `DOWN` / `SIDEWAYS`), target range in ₹ and %, confidence score, key factors, and downside risks.
7. **Storage & Verification:** The prediction is logged to a relational database with strict timestamps. Once market outcomes materialize, actual prices are recorded and prediction error is calculated without ever mutating original prediction records.

## 3. Major Components

- **`app/api/`**: FastAPI application endpoints and route handlers (planned).
- **`app/core/`**: Centralized configuration (`config.py`), logging foundation (`logging_config.py`), and canonical schema contracts (`schemas.py`).
- **`app/database/`**: Relational database persistence (SQLite initially, PostgreSQL migration path).
- **`app/market/`**: Market data acquisition, cleaning, technical feature engineering, and market breadth.
- **`app/news/`**: Financial news ingestion, deduplication, and entity linking.
- **`app/nlp/`**: FinBERT sentiment scoring and textual analysis.
- **`app/prediction/`**: Numerical ML predictor, LLM predictor, and ensemble synthesis.
- **`app/training/`**: Walk-forward validation, dataset splits without temporal leakage, and controlled retraining.
- **`app/history/`**: Prediction audit logs, performance evaluation, and accuracy tracking.

## 4. Current Status: Day 3 (Market-Data Schema + Source Investigation)

Day 3 defines the market-data layer architecture, source evaluation, and provider contract before historical collection begins on Day 4.

### Current Features
- Defined 16-phase long-term project roadmap and architecture documentation.
- Centralized, environment-driven configuration layer (`app/core/config.py`) with safe non-secret defaults.
- Structured application logging system (`app/core/logging_config.py`) with configurable log levels.
- Canonical market-data contracts (`MarketOHLCV`, `MarketQuote`, `DataSourceMetadata` in `app/core/schemas.py`) enforcing point-in-time timestamps and structural bounds.
- Market-data module package (`app/market/` and `app/market/providers/`).
- Minimal historical provider abstraction (`BaseMarketDataProvider`) decoupling external sources from downstream pipelines.
- Indian equity source investigation and evaluation cataloged in `docs/data-sources.md`.
- Selected initial target equity (`BHARTIARTL`) and shortlisted provider for Day 4 (`yfinance` with status `PLANNED / TO BE VERIFIED`).
- 26 automated unit tests passing across foundation, core settings, logging, canonical schemas, and market provider contracts.
